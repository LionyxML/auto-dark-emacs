#+TITLE: Auto-Dark-Emacs

Want Emacs to respect your MacOS dark mode settings? Well then this package is for you!

* Install

Add =auto-dark-emacs.el= to your =load-path= and =(require 'auto-dark)=.

Or, you can copy the contents into your dotemacs.

* Usage

Customize the variables =auto-dark-dark-theme= and
=auto-dark-light-theme= to decide which themes are used for light and
dark modes. They are provided under the =auto-dark= customization group.

Watch with amazement as Emacs updates as you toggle the settings!
